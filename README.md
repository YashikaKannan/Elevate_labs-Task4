This project uses logistic regression to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign based on diagnostic features. The model is trained on a dataset with labeled tumor diagnoses.

## Features
- Data preprocessing including label encoding and missing value handling.
- Feature scaling with standardization.
- Train-test split.
- Model training using logistic regression.
- Evaluation with confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

### Tech :
- Python 
- pandas
- scikit-learn
